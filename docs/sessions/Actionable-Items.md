# Actionable Items

Rolling priority list maintained across sessions. Items flow: Priority → in-progress → Completed Archive. Parked items are deferred pending dependencies.

## Priority (Session 8)

1. **Deploy workflow upgrade.** Replace `scp -r` with either `git pull` on the Pi or `rsync --exclude` from Windows. `scp` pulls stale `__pycache__` dirs and has no exclude support. Short, unblocks every code change after it. Recommend `git` — Pi can just pull `main`.
2. **Reconcile `deploy/apollo.service` template with reality.** Template assumes user `apollo` at `/opt/apollo` with `NoNewPrivileges` + `ProtectSystem=strict`. Actual deployed unit uses `cypherklein` at `/home/cypherklein/apollo` with no hardening. Either update the template or document divergence as intentional.
3. **First real endpoint — T0 keyword dispatcher + `/dispatch` route.** First Apollo behavior beyond `/health`. Validates the tool-first architecture before LLM fallback layers.

## Parked

1. **STT on device** — `faster-whisper` install, mic capture via `pyaudio` or similar, basic `/transcribe` endpoint. Larger scope; Pi 5 performance validation involved. Queue after dispatcher exists.
2. **SSH key auth on Pi** — currently password-only. Keys would let Claude run commands non-interactively from Windows (eliminating the `!` prefix interactive flow entirely). Low urgency, high quality-of-life.
3. **Halo glasses integration** — awaiting hardware.
4. **ESP32 ring (BLE trigger)** — awaiting hardware + Bluetooth stack decisions.
5. **Overlayfs read-only root** — Session 5 integration-risk mitigation #6 (SD/NVMe corruption protection). Defer until pipelines are working; premature hardening otherwise.
6. **Combined USB audio device** — Session 5 integration-risk mitigation #5 (audio clock drift). Defer until audio I/O is being built.
